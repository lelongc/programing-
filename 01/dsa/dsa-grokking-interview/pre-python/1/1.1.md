### **Lesson 1.1: Variables, Data Types & The `print` Function**

#### **1. The `print()` Function - Your Loudspeaker**

- **Purpose:** Displays anything you want on the Terminal screen.
- **Usage:** Super simple syntax: `print(what_you_want_to_print)`

```python
# 1. Print a line of text (called a string)
# Note: Text must always be enclosed in double quotes "" or single quotes ''
print("Hello, world!")
print('Let’s start learning Python!')

# 2. Print a number
print(1995)

# 3. Print the result of a calculation
print(10 + 5) # Will print 15

# 4. Print multiple things at once, separated by commas
print("My name is:", "Bao", "Age:", 28)
# Output: My name is: Bao Age: 28
# (Python automatically adds a space between parts)
```

#### **2. Variables - Labeled Boxes**

Now, suppose you have an important piece of information, such as a user's name, and you want to use it in multiple places in your program. Instead of typing that name repeatedly, you can "store" it in a "box" and "label" that box. That "labeled box" is called a **variable**.

- **Purpose:** Store data for easy reuse and management.
- **Usage:** Syntax is `variable_name = value`

```python
# Create a variable named 'player_name' and store the value "Knight" in it
player_name = "Knight"

# Now just call the variable name to retrieve the value inside
print("Welcome player:")
print(player_name)

# You can change the value in the box anytime
player_name = "Archer"
print("Character class has changed to:")
print(player_name)

# Variables can also store numbers
player_level = 10
print("Current level:")
print(player_level)

# Use variables in calculations
player_level = player_level + 1 # Level up
print("Congratulations on leveling up!")
print(player_level)
```

**Tips for Naming Variables (Important!):**

- Variable names should be in English.
- Use `snake_case`, i.e., words connected by underscores (`_`). Example: `my_first_name`, `user_age`.
- Names should be meaningful (use `user_age` instead of `x`).
- Cannot start with a number.

#### **3. Data Types - The Type of Item in the Box**

Python needs to know the "type" of item you store in each box (variable) to handle it correctly. You can't divide a string by a number, right? That's why **data types** exist.

Here are the 4 most basic types you need to know:

1. **`str` (String):** A sequence of characters, simply put, **text/letters**. Always enclosed in `""` or `''`.
   ```python
   greeting = "Hello there!"
   book_title = 'How Steel Was Tempered'
   ```
2. **`int` (Integer):** Whole numbers without decimal points.
   ```python
   quantity = 100
   negative_number = -5
   ```
3. **`float` (Float):** Numbers with decimal points.
   ```python
   average_score = 8.5
   fuel_price = 25550.5
   ```
4. **`bool` (Boolean):** A special data type with only 2 values: `True` or `False`. Very important for decision-making.
   ```python
   is_logged_in = True
   has_weapon = False
   ```

**How to Check the Type of a Variable?** Use the `type()` function:

```python
my_name = "Bao"
my_age = 28
my_gpa = 3.5
is_handsome = True

print(type(my_name))      # Will print: <class 'str'>
print(type(my_age))       # Will print: <class 'int'>
print(type(my_gpa))       # Will print: <class 'float'>
print(type(is_handsome))  # Will print: <class 'bool'>
```

### **Summary & Practice Exercises**

Here’s an example that combines all the above knowledge:

```python
# Declare variables with different data types
character_name = "Aragon"
character_age = 87
character_class = "Ranger"
is_king = True

# Print information beautifully using f-strings
# (f-strings are a fancy way to embed variables into strings)
print(f"--- Character Information ---")
print(f"Name: {character_name}")
print(f"Age: {character_age}")
print(f"Class: {character_class}")
print(f"Is a king? {is_king}")
```

**Your Exercise:**

Create a file named `bai_1_1.py` and write a program:

1. Create 4 variables to store your personal information: `ten` (str), `nam_sinh` (int), `chieu_cao_met` (float, e.g., 1.75), and `da_tot_nghiep` (bool).
2. Calculate your current age by subtracting `nam_sinh` from the current year (2025). Store the result in a new variable named `tuoi`.
3. Use `print()` and f-strings to display a complete introduction about yourself, including all the above information (name, age, height, graduation status).
