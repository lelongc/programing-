### **Lesson 1.4: Data Structure `List` - Equivalent to Arrays**

#### **1. What is a List?**

Think of a `List` as a shopping list or a bookshelf. It has the following characteristics:

- **A collection:** Can contain multiple items inside.
- **Ordered:** Items are arranged in a specific order, and that order does not change unless you modify it.
- **Mutable:** You can easily add, remove, or change items in the list.
- **Can hold anything:** A `List` can contain numbers, strings, `True`/`False`, or even another `List`!

**How to create a List:** Use square brackets `[]`, with elements separated by commas.

```python
# An empty list
empty_list = []

# A list containing names of fruits (all strings)
fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana", "Pineapple"]
print(fruits)

# A list containing numbers
scores = [10, 8.5, 9, 7]
print(scores)

# A list containing different types of data
personal_info = ["Bao", 28, 1.75, True]
print(personal_info)
```

#### **2. Accessing elements (Indexing)**

Just like numbered drawers, elements in a `List` are also numbered, called **index**.

**Golden Rule:** Index in Python **starts from 0**, not 1!

- The first element has an index of `0`.
- The second element has an index of `1`.
- ... and so on.

**Usage:** `list_name[index]`

```python
fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana", "Pineapple"]
#          0         1         2          3

# Access the first element
first_item = fruits[0]
print(f"The first item is: {first_item}") # Result: Apple

# Access the third element
third_item = fruits[2]
print(f"The third item is: {third_item}") # Result: Banana

# Handy tip: Access from the end
# -1 is the last element, -2 is the second last, ...
last_item = fruits[-1]
print(f"The last item is: {last_item}") # Result: Pineapple
```

#### **3. Modifying elements in a List**

Since a List is mutable, you can easily replace an old item with a new one at a specific position.

```python
fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"]
print(f"Initial list: {fruits}")

# Tired of Orange, replace it with Mango
fruits[1] = "Mango"
print(f"List after modification: {fruits}") # Result: ['Apple', 'Mango', 'Banana']
```

#### **4. Common "actions" (methods) with Lists**

Lists come with many convenient built-in "actions." Here are the ones you'll use most often.

- **Adding elements:**

  - `.append(item)`: Add an `item` to the **end** of the list.
    ```python
    todo_list = ["Learn Python", "Sleep"]
    todo_list.append("Play games")
    print(todo_list) # ['Learn Python', 'Sleep', 'Play games']
    ```
  - `.insert(index, item)`: Insert an `item` at any `index` position.
    ```python
    todo_list.insert(1, "Have dinner") # Insert "Have dinner" at index 1
    print(todo_list) # ['Learn Python', 'Have dinner', 'Sleep', 'Play games']
    ```

- **Removing elements:**

  - `.remove(item)`: Remove the first occurrence of `item` it finds.
    ```python
    todo_list.remove("Sleep")
    print(todo_list) # ['Learn Python', 'Have dinner', 'Play games']
    ```
  - `.pop(index)`: Remove and return the element at position `index`. If no `index` is provided, it removes the last element.
    ```python
    completed_task = todo_list.pop() # Remove and return "Play games"
    print(f"Task just completed: {completed_task}")
    print(f"Remaining list: {todo_list}") # ['Learn Python', 'Have dinner']
    ```

- **Other actions:**

  - `len(my_list)`: Get the length (number of elements) of the list.
    ```python
    remaining_tasks = len(todo_list)
    print(f"Number of tasks left: {remaining_tasks}") # Result: 2
    ```
  - **Slicing:** Extract a sublist from the original list. Syntax: `my_list[start:end]`
    ```python
    numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(numbers[1:4])  # Get from index 1 to before index 4 -> [1, 2, 3]
    print(numbers[:3])   # Get from the start to before index 3 -> [0, 1, 2]
    print(numbers[2:])   # Get from index 2 to the end -> [2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

### **Practice Exercise üìù**

Create a file `lesson_1_4.py` and write a program to manage your favorite movie list.

1. Start by creating a `list` named `favorite_movies` containing 2-3 movies you like (e.g., `["The Dark Knight", "Inception"]`).
2. Print the message: `"The current movie list has [number] movies."` using the `len()` function.
3. A friend recommends a new movie. Add that movie to the **end** of the list using `.append()`.
4. You suddenly remember a "classic" movie and want it to be at the **beginning** of the list. Use `.insert()` to do this.
5. Print the full movie list after adding.
6. You rewatch a movie and decide you no longer like it. Remove it from the list using `.remove()`.
7. Finally, print your final movie list.
