### **Lesson 1.3: Receiving Data from Users (User Input)**

#### **1. The `input()` Function - Your Microphone**

To allow the program to "listen" to the user, Python provides a very simple function called `input()`.

- **Purpose:** Pause the program, display a line of message (called a prompt), and wait for the user to type something and press Enter.
- **Usage:** `variable_name = input("Message for the user: ")`

Whatever the user types will be stored in `variable_name` as a string.

**Basic Example:**

```python
# Ask for the user's name and store it in the 'name' variable
name = input("What is your name? ")

# Greet them back
print(f"Hello {name}! Nice to meet you.")
```

When you run this code, the terminal will display `What is your name? ` and the cursor will blink, waiting for you. After you type your name and press Enter, the program will proceed to execute the `print` line below.

### **2. The Biggest Issue: `input()` Always Returns a String**

This is a **super important** point to remember. Even if the user enters the number `25`, Python will still interpret it as the string `"25"` and not the number `25`.

**Let‚Äôs see what happens:**

```python
first_number = input("Enter the first number: ") # Assume the user enters 5
second_number = input("Enter the second number: ") # Assume the user enters 10

# Expecting 5 + 10 = 15
result = first_number + second_number
print(f"The result is: {result}")

# Actual output: The result is: 510
```

Why does it output `510`? Because Python is "concatenating strings," taking the string `"5"` and appending it to the string `"10"`. To solve this issue, we need to "type cast."

### **3. Type Casting - Converting Data**

Type casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.

- `int(value)`: Converts `value` to an integer.
- `float(value)`: Converts `value` to a floating-point number.

**Now let‚Äôs fix the example above:**

```python
first_number_str = input("Enter the first number: ") # Assume the user enters 5
second_number_str = input("Enter the second number: ") # Assume the user enters 10

# Type cast from string to integer
first_number_int = int(first_number_str)
second_number_int = int(second_number_str)

# Now the addition will be correct
result = first_number_int + second_number_int
print(f"The correct result is: {result}")

# Output: The correct result is: 15
```

**Tip:** You can combine the two steps for brevity:
`first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))`

### **Practice Exercise üèãÔ∏è**

Write a program `bai_1_3.py` to create a simple "age calculator."

1. **Ask for the user's name** and store it in a variable.
2. **Ask for the user's birth year.**
3. **Type cast** the birth year from a string to an integer.
4. **Calculate the user's age** by subtracting their birth year from the current year (`2025`).
5. **Print** a complete greeting message, e.g., `"Hello Long, so this year you are 20 years old!"`
