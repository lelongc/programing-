### **Lesson 1.2: Types of Operators**

#### **1. Arithmetic Operators - Math Toolbox**

These are the most familiar ones, used to perform basic calculations.

| Operator | Name               | Example   | Result | Note                             |
| :------- | :----------------- | :-------- | :----- | :------------------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition           | `10 + 5`  | `15`   |                                  |
| `-`      | Subtraction        | `10 - 5`  | `5`    |                                  |
| `*`      | Multiplication     | `10 * 5`  | `50`   |                                  |
| `/`      | Division           | `10 / 4`  | `2.5`  | Always returns a float (`float`) |
| `//`     | Floor Division     | `10 // 4` | `2`    | "Chops off" the decimal part     |
| `%`      | Modulo (Remainder) | `10 % 3`  | `1`    | Useful for checking even/odd     |
| `**`     | Exponentiation     | `2 ** 3`  | `8`    | 2 raised to the power of 3       |

**See it in action:**

```python
# Suppose I have scores for two subjects
diem_toan = 8
diem_ly = 7.5

# Calculate total score
tong_diem = diem_toan + diem_ly
print(f"Total score: {tong_diem}") # Result: 15.5

# Calculate the number of apples each person gets
so_tao = 25
so_nguoi = 4
tao_moi_nguoi_nhan = so_tao // so_nguoi
tao_con_du = so_tao % so_nguoi
print(f"Each person gets {tao_moi_nguoi_nhan} apples.") # Result: 6
print(f"Remaining apples: {tao_con_du}") # Result: 1
```

#### **2. Comparison Operators - Scales of Justice**

This group’s job is simple: compare two values and always return `True` or `False`.

| Operator | Meaning               | Example  | Result  |
| :------- | :-------------------- | :------- | :------ |
| `==`     | Equal                 | `5 == 5` | `True`  |
| `!=`     | Not equal             | `5 != 5` | `False` |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `5 > 3`  | `True`  |
| `<`      | Less than             | `5 < 3`  | `False` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `5 >= 5` | `True`  |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `5 <= 3` | `False` |

**Big warning:** Beginners often confuse `=` (assignment, "putting something in a box") with `==` (comparison, "weighing two items"). Pay close attention!

**Real-life example:**

```python
tuoi_cua_ban = 19
tuoi_yeu_cau_xem_phim = 18

duoc_phep_xem = tuoi_cua_ban >= tuoi_yeu_cau_xem_phim
print(f"Are you allowed to watch the movie? {duoc_phep_xem}") # Result: True

diem_thi = 8.4
diem_dau = 8.5
thi_dau = diem_thi == diem_dau
print(f"Did you pass the exam? {thi_dau}") # Result: False
```

#### **3. Logical Operators - The Gatekeeper**

This group is used to combine multiple `True`/`False` conditions. Imagine you want to enter an event, and the gatekeeper checks the conditions.

- **`and` (AND):** Requires **ALL** conditions to be `True` for the final result to be `True`.
  - _Gatekeeper says:_ "You need a ticket AND an ID."
- **`or` (OR):** Requires **AT LEAST ONE** condition to be `True` for the final result to be `True`.
  - _Gatekeeper says:_ "You need a student card OR an employee card."
- **`not` (NOT):** Reverses the value. `not True` becomes `False`, and `not False` becomes `True`.
  - _Gatekeeper says:_ "Anyone NOT on the guest list cannot enter."

**Example:**

```python
co_tien = True
quan_con_mo_cua = False
troi_dep = True

# Using 'and': Will you go shopping?
# Must have money AND the store must be open
di_mua_sam = co_tien and quan_con_mo_cua
print(f"Will you go shopping? {di_mua_sam}") # Result: False (because quan_con_mo_cua is False)

# Using 'or': Will you go for a walk?
# Just need nice weather OR money
di_dao = troi_dep or co_tien
print(f"Will you go for a walk? {di_dao}") # Result: True (because both are True)

# Using 'not': Will you stay home?
o_nha = not di_mua_sam
print(f"Will you stay home? {o_nha}") # Result: True (because di_mua_sam is False)
```

#### **Bonus: Operator Precedence**

Just like in math (multiplication/division first, addition/subtraction later), Python has rules for precedence. A simple rule to remember:

1. Parentheses `()` have the highest priority.
2. Exponentiation `**`.
3. `not`, then multiplication `*`, division `/`, `%`, `//`.
4. Addition `+`, subtraction `-`.
5. Comparison operators `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`...
6. Finally, `and` then `or`.

**Best tip:** Don’t try to memorize everything! If you’re unsure, **just use parentheses `()` to group calculations for clarity.**

`ket_qua = 5 + 10 / 2` (Result is 10.0)  
`ket_qua_ro_rang = 5 + (10 / 2)` (This way is much easier to read)

### **Practice Exercises**

Imagine you are coding logic for a game character. Create a file `bai_1_2.py` and do the following:

1. **Declare state variables:**
   ```python
   mau_hien_tai = 75 # Character's health (max 100)
   nang_luong = 50 # Energy (mana)
   co_giap_than = False # Wearing divine armor?
   level = 15
   ```
2. **Write logic and print results:**
   - A monster deals **25** damage. Calculate and print the character's remaining health.
   - Check if the character is "in danger" (defined as health below 50 **AND** not wearing divine armor). Print `True` or `False`.
   - The character wants to use a special move that costs **60** energy. Check if the character has enough energy **OR** is above level 20 (high level gets free usage). Print `True` or `False`.
