### **Step 1: Install Python – The Brain of the System**

Python is the programming language we will use.

1. **Download:**

   - Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - You will see a button to download the latest version (e.g., "Download Python 3.12.4"). Just click it to download.

2. **Installation (Extremely Important!):**

   - Open the `.exe` file you just downloaded.
   - On the first installation screen, **check the "Add Python to PATH" box** at the bottom. This step is crucial—it allows you to run the `python` command anywhere on your computer.
   - Then, click **"Install Now"**.

3. **Verification:**

   - Open **Command Prompt** (type `cmd` in the Windows search bar) or **Terminal** (on macOS/Linux).
   - Type the following command and press Enter: `python --version`
   - If your computer displays the Python version you just installed (e.g., `Python 3.12.4`), congratulations, you've successfully installed the brain!

### **Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – Our Home**

This is where we will write, read, and run code. It's free, powerful, and trusted by most developers.

1. **Download:**

   - Go to the VS Code homepage: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - The website will automatically detect your operating system (Windows, macOS). Click the "Download" button to get it.

2. **Installation:**

   - Just click "Next" and agree to the terms.
   - At the **"Select Additional Tasks"** step, it's recommended to check all boxes, especially **"Add 'Open with Code' action..."**. This lets you right-click any folder and open it in VS Code instantly.

### **Step 3: Add "Limbs" (VS Code Extensions)**

Extensions make VS Code smarter, especially when working with Python.

1. **Open the Extensions area:**

   - Open VS Code.
   - Look at the left sidebar for the icon that looks like stacked squares (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).

2. **Install the following extensions:**

   - In the search box, type each extension name below, pick the one with the most downloads, and click **"Install"**.
   - **Python** (by Microsoft): This extension is **a must-have**. It provides almost everything: code suggestions (IntelliSense), debugging, linting, etc.
   - **Pylance** (by Microsoft): Usually installed together with the Python extension above. Pylance makes code suggestions, analysis, and error detection much faster and smarter.
   - **Black Formatter** (or Prettier): Clean, readable code is very important. This extension will automatically **format your code** to be neat and standard every time you save. Install this to build the habit of writing clean code from the start.

### **Step 4: Test Your "Lab"**

Now let's check if everything works smoothly.

1. Create a new folder somewhere on your computer, e.g., `D:\hoc_python`.
2. Open VS Code. Choose `File > Open Folder...` and select the `hoc_python` folder you just created.
3. In the left sidebar, click the file icon to go back to the file explorer. Click the "New File" icon and name the file `test.py`.
4. Type or copy the following code into `test.py`:

   ```python
   print("Hello, phong thi nghiem cua toi!")

   ten_cua_ban = "Test"
   print(f"Chao mung {ten_cua_ban} den voi the gioi code.")
   ```

5. **Run the code:**

   - In the top right corner of VS Code, you'll see a triangle (Play button). Click it.
   - A **TERMINAL** window will appear at the bottom. If you see the lines `"Hello, phong thi nghiem cua toi!"` and `"Chao mung Test den voi the gioi code."` printed, your lab is officially up and running!

Congratulations! Now you have a professional programming environment, ready to tackle the next lessons.
